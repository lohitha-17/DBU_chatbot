# Chatbot for DBU

## Overview
This project is a conversational chatbot designed to enhance user interaction and support for DBU (Database Utilities or a specific domain). Built using cutting-edge NLP technologies, the chatbot can assist users with queries, provide recommendations, and streamline data management processes. Its modular architecture ensures scalability and seamless integration with databases for dynamic data retrieval and updates.

## Features
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Understands and responds to user queries accurately.
- **Database Integration**: Connects to FAISS databases to retrieve and update information dynamically.
- **Scalability**: Modular architecture allows for easy feature additions and improvements.
- **Customizable Responses**: Adapts to the specific needs of DBU users.

## Project Objectives
- Simplify database interactions for users.
- Provide quick and accurate responses to database-related queries.
- Demonstrate the integration of NLP with database systems for practical applications.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**: For text processing and analysis.
- **Dialogflow or Rasa**: Chatbot framework for conversational flow (if applicable).
- **SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL)**: Database integration.
- **Flask/Django**: Backend framework for deploying the chatbot (if applicable).

## Key Features Implemented
1. **Data Retrieval**: Users can query the chatbot to fetch specific data from a connected database.
2. **Data Update**: Allows users to modify records through natural language commands.
3. **Error Handling**: Provides helpful feedback when it cannot process a request.
4. **Performance**: Achieves a query-response accuracy of over **92%** during testing.
